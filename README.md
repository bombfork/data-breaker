# data-breaker

**Break what data brokers do.**

data-breaker is a tool that helps you take back control of your personal data. It automates the process of removing your information from as many data brokers as possible and produces clear reports about where your data has been found.

The name says it all: data **broker** → data **breaker**. We're here to break what data brokers do and restore your privacy.

data-breaker is **free and open source**, and always will be.

## What it does

- **Automated removal requests** — Submit deletion/opt-out requests to data brokers on your behalf
- **Presence reports** — Scan data broker databases and show you exactly where your personal information appears
- **Progress tracking** — Follow the status of each removal request over time

## Privacy by design

data-breaker is built for **you**:

- Runs locally under your control
- Your data is never shared with third parties
- You decide what to scan and what to remove
- Fully consent-driven — nothing happens without your explicit approval

## Platform support

data-breaker is a Rust CLI built on these platforms:

- **Linux** — x86_64, aarch64
- **macOS** — x86_64 (Intel), aarch64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** — x86_64
